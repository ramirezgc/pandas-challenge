Purchse counts by gender (Purchasing Analysis (Gender) table)are in proportion to the "Gender Demographics" which means there is not one gender that is overspending within the game. If the game is interested in diversifying the user base, I recommend marketing more towards Females and Other / Non-disclosed genders which would also increase the sales from these groups thereby increasing total revenue as a whole. 

The target age range of players is between 20-24 years at 44.79% (Age Demographics table) but the highest "Average total purchase per person" (Purchasing Analysis (Age) table) is the age group 35-39. I recommend marketing heavier to the 35-39 age group to increase total game revenue. 

Three of the most profitable items (Most Profitable Items table) are also among the top 5 most popular items (Most Popular Items table). I recommend increasing the Item Price for the most popular items which players are already buying the most often.
